Hacienda Pinilla’s tennis facilities will satisfy anyone from beginners to near pros. A top quality surface and plenty of room along the sidelines of the two courts – the only problem will be being so distracted by breathtaking natural setting, surrounded by native Guanacaste trees, that you’ll miss that topspin serve coming at you. A full lighting system is available for night play.

The courts are staffed with a professional instructor who can provide lessons to help you improve your game. The pro will even join if you need a doubles partner or a hitting foil. Reasonable fees – $5 an hour by day, $10 an hour at night, racquet rental for $5 an hour, and lessons for $25 an hour, racquet stringing, pro shop, parking, nearby restaurant and bathroom facilities – all make this as top tier an experience as you’d have at the best facilities in the world.
