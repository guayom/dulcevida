Living at Hacienda Pinilla is like living in a nature preserve. The residential development property sits on an extensive dry tropical forest, home to a wide variety of birds, insects, amphibians, reptiles and mammals ranging from toucans and butterflies to frogs, turtles, iguanas and monkeys – all of which can be seen right there along 16 kilometers of picturesque nature trails.

In its continuing awareness of the importance of natural forest habitats for animals – as well as residents and visitors – over the past few years Hacienda Pinilla has implemented an aggressive reforestation program resulting in the planting of thousands of tree species native to the region. Well planned wildlife corridors ensure all of its residents, humans and animals, live in peace in harmony, allowing the safe passage through Hacienda Pinilla’s residential communities. It is not uncommon to have a troop of howler monkeys pass through your back yard or a receive visits from a company of small parrots.

For those who have always wanted to see giant sea turtles nesting, Costa Rica is one of the few places in the world that offers the opportunity to witness one of nature’s most spectacular miracles.

The Giant Leather Back turtle nesting season extends from October through to February with hundreds of turtles coming ashore to dig out nests with their flippers and lay up to 100 of their eggs, a process that can often take up to three hours. The north end of Playa Langosta and north to Las Baulas National Park in Playa Grande are home to this amazing homecoming and annual nesting.
