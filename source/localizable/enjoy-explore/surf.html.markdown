One of the benefits of residing at Hacienda Pinilla is their 6 miles of Blue Flag certified beaches which provide 4 world class waves when the surf is firing. From Playa Langosta to Playa Avellanas surfers can experience a variety of waves from hollow sand bottom beach breaks, river mouths and rock/reef point breaks. From beginners to advanced surfers, there are miles of beach to explore and plenty of uncrowded waves to be had.

Little Hawaii is Hacienda Pinilla’s best kept secret. Located right in front of the Beach Club, only Hacienda Pinilla residents and guest can park right in front of this wave and access it, which keep it relatively uncrowded. When south swells are at their peak, Little Hawaii will hold swell well above 10’ to 12’ and is one of the best breaks in the region when the surf gets big.

The benefits of surfing at Hacienda Pinilla are obvious: the beaches have consistent waves, you can surf year round, the water temperature is perfect all year, off-shore winds prevail most of the year and the lineups are not crowded.
