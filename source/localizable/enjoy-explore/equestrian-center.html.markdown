El Establo at Hacienda Pinilla has more than 40 horses for tours through rainforests, on beaches, and for midnight rides. There are also buggy rides.

The horseback tours take you across 6 kilometers of totally natural trails, along rivers and a lake and for a nice trot on the beach at Playa Langosta. Along the way you’ll undoubtedly admire the enormous diversity in wildlife: wild birds, monkeys and crocodiles, and rich green flora and fauna. On one stop, at the top of a hill, you can get a 360-view of the entire Hacienda Pinilla property, from Avellanas to Langosta.

El Establo has an equestrian school and riding ring for our visitors. A professional staff of 14 maintains the facilities, arrange shows and conduct horseback rides.

Kids aged 6 to 9 can enjoy for horseback vacation camping, riding atop gentle ponies.

If you’re not a rider but an aficionado of these four-legged favorites of the local Guanacastecans, you can catch an evening show at the ranch’s Fiesta Sabanera – a great colorful display of local horsemanship, music, and dance that brings you closer to this country’s cultural roots.
