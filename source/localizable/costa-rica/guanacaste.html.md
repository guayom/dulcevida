La Dulce Vida is nestled in the exclusive Hacienda Pinilla community in the province of Guanacaste, on the North Pacific Coast of Costa Rica.  Guanacaste offers the best beaches of Costa Rica, however not all of the attractions in this area have to do with the blue ocean and warm, sandy beaches; there are also pristine rivers, volcanoes and important protected areas such as Santa Rosa National Park, not only a Costa Rican historic site but also home to 10 different habitats including mangroves, swamps and evergreen and dry forests.

Another protected treasure of Guanacaste is the Rincon de la Vieja Volcano National Park, a refuge for birds and wildlife, featuring impressive vegetation, bubbling mud holes, refreshing river pools and waterfalls.

The capital city of the Province of Guanacaste is Liberia, where you will find souvenir shops, supermarkets, restaurants, hotels and an International Airport. Located 45 min. southwest from the airport you will find Hacienda Pinilla where beautiful resort and tourist facilities lay among some of the most beautiful beaches of Costa Rica, including Playa Langosta and Playa Avellanas with amazing panoramic views, white sand and blue waters.

Playa Negra to the south is small surfing and fishing village with some amazing restaurants, and Tamarindo Beach to the north, a mix of a fishing village and a surfing town with a lot of restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops, supermarkets and a very active nightlife.

Guanacaste is a paradise for bird watchers and nature lovers, a charming experience including calm waters with great swimming, fine sand beaches with magnificent views, generous palm trees giving shade, spectacular sunsets, national parks with lush vegetation and a wide range of activities such as kayaking, snorkeling, diving, Canopy Tours, sport fishing, horseback riding and much more

Guanacaste is also home to one of Costa Rica's two international airports. Located in Liberia, the Daniel Oduber International Airport receives many non-stop direct flights from major US cities. Just a short 2 to 3.5 hour flight from many US airports, Guanacaste is an easy destination. And once on the ground most tourist resort locations are less than an hour drive, making it one of the closest tropical tourist destinations in Latin America.
