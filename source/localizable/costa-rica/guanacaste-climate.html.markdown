title: Guanacaste Climate
---
Guanacaste experiences much less rain than the rest of Costa Rica, with little rain and consistent heat from November to April, and a green/wet season from late May to November. Its hot, dry climate makes tropical dry forests the province’s natural vegetation type.

The main reason for the diversity in Costa Rica’s weather is the various elevations at which different parts of the country are located. For example, Guanacaste has a dry arid climate as it sits on the lowlands.

The perfect time to visit Guanacaste is year around. No matter if you visit during the dry season or during the wet season, both provide spectacular advantages. The dry season provides plenty of sunshine, while the wet season brings the trees into bloom with explosions of colors and fragrances. The hills become carpeted in brilliant green.

Guanacaste beaches experience predominately off-shore winds all year long, providing residents and guests with magical sunsets and an average water temperature in the low 80s.
