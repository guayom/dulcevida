## Architects and Builders Program

Crafting your own home is a fantastic, rewarding experience. Selecting an architect and builder is a critical step in this building process. Here at La Dulce Vida, home site owners have several options available to them when it comes to initiating the design and building of their home; we can assist with turnkey design build services, introduce you to a few of our preapproved architects and builders for you to choose from, or you can manage the project on your own using architects and builders of your choice.

We created the Architects and Builders Program in an effort to simplify the process for owners in La Dulce Vida,. Our due diligence of architects and builders in the area concluded that these select partners use both innovative design and quality materials in the construction of luxury homes that are ecologically sustainable in the unique tropical environment of Costa Rica. We are happy to provide an introduction of these select architects and builders upon your request.

And, if additional support is required, we offer turnkey project management and design build services. This includes coordinating all phases of construction to provide a seamless, transparent and worry free building process. We have vast international experience in residential and commercial development and encourage quality construction that is not only suitable for the Costa Rican climate but also promotes minimal maintenance and energy usage. We know and believe that our ability to work with our property owners and their selected parties at every stage of the building process is one of the best ways to ensure a project’s success.
