Costa Rica is a destination with an abundance of natural beauty, picture perfect beaches and sunsets, friendly locals and a laid-back lifestyle. During the entire year, and in most parts of the country, there are a great variety of activities for adults and kids. Whether it is to find the best surf, yoga, spa, tennis, sport fishing, golf, or zip line, it can be frustratingly difficult to navigate the best Costa Rica has to offer with limited time. From finding the nearest waterfall excursion, private chef, transportation, tee times, or healthcare facilities, La Dulce Vida Concierge Center handles every request with efficiency and assurance, and strives to make the impossible, possible.

Our team, led by Giannina Coto, is available to ensure our residents and their guests enjoy their experience at La Dulce Vida. Nella finds inspiration in understanding each individual client’s needs and ensuring their satisfaction. She has over 15 years of concierge and property management experience.
