At Hacienda Pinilla, you'll see a shining example of Young's passion for the game, respect for tradition, concern for the environment and sharp eye for detail. Each hole was designed to conform to the slopes and contours of the natural landscape. Not only has he met the highest standards required by international golf organizations in building the course, but recently the property earned certification as an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary for its preservation of the ecological balance of the area.

Here, golfers have a course that offers picturesque scenery, immaculate conditions, frequent glimpses of exotic wildlife and the inviting El Corral Turn house. In short, it's a course you'll not only want to play again and again, you'll want the pride of ownership for years to come.
