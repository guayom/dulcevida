Hacienda Pinilla boasts three miles of beautiful coastline and is home to three of Guanacaste’s most beautiful beaches: Playa Avellanas, Playa Mansita and Playa Langosta, awarded the Blue Flag certificate for its beauty, and clean water and superior services.

At these beaches, property owners and guests enjoy an array of water sports options such as snorkeling, sports fishing, kayaking and surfing. Palm tree shade and white sand intermingled with small shells provide a warm, discreet environment, making it an appealing, pleasant beach in all respects.

Hacienda Pinilla is also home to 3 world class surf spots: Little Hawaii, Avellanas Rivermouth and Langosta. With limited access only to residents and their guests, surfers enjoy incredible warm water surf year round with very few people in the line-up (don’t tell anyone). Playa Negra, Playa Tamarindo and Playa Grande are all a short drive away and Witche’s Rock and Ollie’s Point are a one hour boat ride to the north.

For those who enjoying fishing, the stretch of beach just in front of La Dulce Vida offers some of the best in shore fishing in the region. With excellent fishing all year you can enjoy catching Snook, Snapper, Rooster Fish, Jacks, Grouper and many other species right from the beach.

For the diver and spearfishermen in the family, there are excellent rock/reef formations all along the Hacineda Pinilla coast, abundant with marine life. Your back yard is literally like a fresh seafood market, the shores are loaded with lobster and a delicious variety of fish, all are just steps from your back door.
