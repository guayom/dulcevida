Hacienda Pinilla is a coastal resort and residential community which resides within 4,500 acres of natural habitat and has been developed in sustainable harmony with the utmost care for the environment while maintaining the natural beauty that can only be found in the Guanacaste region of Costa Rica.  Hacienda Pinilla has designated much of the 4,500 acres to permanent preservation, designed to protect the abundant wildlife and diverse flora and fauna found in this special part of Costa Rica . The 18 hole Championship Golf Course is certified by the Audubon Society and was designed with absolute minimal disruption to the balance of nature on the property.
